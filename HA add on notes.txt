- How do you want the cluster to respond on failure?

1. Define failure scenarios
example:
    Node failure due to power loss
    Node failure due to system panic
    Communication failure, through network failure
    Storage failure

2. Determine response to failure
example:
    Power off a failing node, then power it back on immediately
    Power off a failing node, then wait a defined period of time before powering it on
    Wait for administrator intervention
    Contact your Red Hat Service Representative

3. Determine how to configure fencing
example:
    What type of fencing do I want?
    What fencing agent in particular do I want?
    What fencing options are available?
    How do I choose my hardware?
    How can I use multiple fencing devices?
    What network equipment do I need to to address my use cases?
    How can I integrate my fencing configuration with the cluster, for example through cluster network configuration or defined timeouts?

What is fencing in RHEL HA?
Fencing is a critical component of Red Hat HA clusters, as it ensures data integrity, cluster reliability, and proper failover behavior in the face of node failures or malfunctions. 
Types of Fencing: https://access.redhat.com/articles/2205471
example:
    Power fence agents: 
        The cluster software logs in via telnet, ssh, or SNMP to the device such as an APC switch, Dell DRAC, HP iLO, IBM RSA, or similar device and turns off (and optionally on) the power for the cluster node. This method will execute a hard "off" action.
    I/O fence agents: 
        The cluster software logs in to a fibre channel switch via telnet or ssh and disables the port(s) for that node, thereby cutting of its access to shared storage. This method requires that an administrator manually reboot or shutdown the errant node to recover it, and log in to the switch interface to re-enable the appropriate port(s). This can also be achieved via SCSI reservation fencing.
